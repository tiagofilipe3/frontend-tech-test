## Useful Information

The repository is based on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which gives you access to a few useful commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimises/minifies the build for the best performance.

**We'd strongly recommend running `build` before submitting your solution.**
